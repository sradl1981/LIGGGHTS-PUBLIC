fix growth command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID group-ID growth N atom diameter variableNameForGrowth growToValue growValue variableNames <4variableNames> :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command :ulb,l
growth = style name of this fix command :l
N = adapt simulation settings every this many timesteps :l
atom diameter = mandatory keywords :l
variableNameForGrowth = mandatory name of the variable to store growth. Must start with 'v_' :l
growToValue = mandatory keyword :l
growValue = either a fixed numerical value, or 'DYNAMIC'. The latter will activate a dynamic calculation of the diameter. :l
variableNames = optional keyword to activate the input for the variable names that control the DYNAMIC diameter adjustment :l
<4variableNames> = mandatory keyword in case 'variableNames' is set. The default variableNames are: supersatFluid heatFluid saturationdensity supersatTransCoeff. These values will be overwritten by the specified variable names. For each of these variables, a fix property/atom must exist before this fix is called! :l
:ule

[Examples:]
variable    particleDensity equal 2500 :pre
variable    radiusInactive equal  5.0e-3  :pre
fix         supersaturationCrit all property/global supersaturationCrit scalar 1.2 :pre
fix         surfaceTension all property/global surfaceTension scalar 0.7 :pre
fix         supersatFluid all property/atom supersatFluid scalar no yes no none :pre
fix         temp all property/atom temp scalar no yes no none :pre
fix         saturationdensity all property/atom saturationdensity scalar no yes no none :pre
fix         transferCoefficient all property/atom transferCoefficient scalar no yes no none  :pre

fix         grow all growth 100 atom diameter v_dgrown growToValue DYNAMIC variableNames supersatFluid temp saturationdensity transferCoefficient :pre

[Description:]

This fix wraps around the "fix adapt" command to more elegantly
control the growth of particles. 
The "DYNAMIC" option allows the user to grow the particles depending
on local conditions (e.g., the supersaturation). Therefore, a simple
nucleation-growth model has been implemented (hardcoded) that 
sets the particle diameter dynamically during a simulation.

Important Note: for the 'DYNAMIC' option the user must create a number
of fix property/atom, fix property/global, and variables. 

property/atom: 4 fixes corresponding to the variableNames :l
property/global: (i) supersaturationCrit, (ii) surfaceTension :l
variables : (i) radiusInactive, (ii) particleDensity :l

Note, that particles with a radius lower than 'radiusInactive' are 
not considered for growth (i.e., they are considered as
 un-nucleated seeds). Thus, one can add particles with very small
diameter (below 'radiusInactive'), track them through a given region,
and let them nucleate once the fluid surrounding them has exceeded
the critical supersaturation specified by 'supersaturationCrit'.
